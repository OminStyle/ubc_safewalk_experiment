          We are students at UBC EECE 418 Human Computer
          Interaction course and we are simulating requesting
          Safewalk with mobile app instead of making a phone call.
          None of the data used in the forms will be saved so please
          go through the app as if you are really using it. Please do not refresh the page during the experiment!
